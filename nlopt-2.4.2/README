This is NLOpt 2.4.2, modified to compile under VS2017.
The Makefiles and configure script are removed.
Some files were modified to remove compilation warning,
mostly implicit double->int cast and signed/unsigned confusion.
I also had to remove stogo and the fortran-to-c converted direct algorithms,
as I couldn't get them to compile with VS.

See README.orig for the original NLOpt README.
